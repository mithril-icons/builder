# Mithril Icons Builder



Easy to use and customizable [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/) icon components based on various open source icon sets with Typescript support.

## Highlights
- First class Typescript support
- Ability to add any SVG attribute to the icons
- Tree-shaking friendly structure
- No `m.trust` calls - all the icons are defined explicitly


## Usage
### Using the icons
If you just want to use the generated icons install one of the relevant NPM libraries:
- [@mithril-icons/feather](./packages/feather)
- [@mithril-icons/clarity](./packages/clarity)

### Working with builder
If you want to play with builder iteself - check out icon generation, contribute new icon set etc. you need to clone the repository.

A good way to start exploring the codebase is to examine `just.config.ts` file and then one of the generators in `generators` folder
